            <li>2 teaspoons sriracha, more if desired</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>¼ cup ground flaxseed</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice, freshly cooked so that it’s sticky*</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
            <li>Vegan Worcestershire sauce, for brushing</li>
            <li>Nonstick cooking spray, for grilling</li>
            <li>Hamburger buns & desired burger fixings</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining panko.
            </li>
            <li>Form into 8 patties, place them on a large plate and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>If you're grilling the patties, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the patties with olive oil and spray the grill with cooking spray. Place the patties on the grill and use a spatula to press down lightly. Grill for 7 minutes on the first side, flip, and grill for 6 to 7 minutes on the second side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Alternately, cook the patties on the stove. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and cook the patties for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, brush with Worcestershire sauce, and serve with desired fixings.</li>
        </ol>
